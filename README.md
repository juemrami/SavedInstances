- Tracks seals, resources, money, and other useful currencies (configurable display)
- Tracks weekly World Boss Loots

## Known Issues

SavedInstances is pretty good, but it's still not quite perfect. There are currently a few issues:

- When first installed, SavedInstances has no knowledge of your other characters: you'll need to log into each for their information to be recorded
- (*) = Indicates a feature displaying data that cannot be directly queried from the server, but rather is collected by the addon while observing player actions. Actions taken while the addon is disabled, or from other computers, or before a client crash, can result in this display being temporarily out-of-date or incomplete.
- Lockout time remaining and other features may be off by an hour when your region changes to and from Daylight Savings Time, or if you manually adjust the timezone of your computer.
- Tracking for the 10 instance per hour limit uses heuristic detection and hence may occasionally be inaccurate (notably when another player has lead and performs explicit resets), but does a reasonable job for common cases.

## Usage

SavedInstances will create a new button on the minimap, and you can use it to interact with SavedInstances just fine. The addon can also be displayed using a LibDataBroker-compatible display addon. I personally use Chocolate Bar which works quite well. Finally, you can bind a key or use "/si show" to open a detached window containing the display.

### Multiple Accounts

If you are playing with multiple WoW accounts but want to keep track of all of them, you need to use [Symlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) on your saved variable files.
