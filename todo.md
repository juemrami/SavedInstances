# Todo

- [ ] Add caching for the tooltip scanner, use the hyperlink as a key maybe

- [ ] Compare retail functionality between this addon and the original

- [ ] Move all the logic relating to tracking instance lockouts out of `Core.lua` and into its own module file. 

- [ ] Move any building of AceConfig options into their respective module files. ie currency options should be in `Currency.lua`

- [ ] Clean-up SavedVars (currently seems like theres alot of random junk.)
    - up whats being saved to
    - anything thats super computationally expensive should be saved to SavedVars but thats it. 

- [ ] Add option to ignore characters on servers with a different season (ie dont show SoD characters while on an SoM or Hardcore character unless toggled)

- [ ] add category headers for the currencies in classic, so the options dont look as complicated/messy for it. (since there is alot of currencies to pick from)

- [ ] compare the instance history tracking to something like Nova Instance Tracker, and see if there is anything that can be improved upon.
